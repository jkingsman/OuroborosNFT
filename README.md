Each NFT has its own simple generative SVG image and a small note at the bottom asking to open the image in a new tab to view the entire NFT

When you open image, it places the user's NFT up top, a "What is this" section, and a "connect wallet" CTA
    When you connect, you see a big MINT NOW cta, and a gallery of other users' NFTs
